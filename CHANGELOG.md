# 2.5.1

Fix a runtime crash that occurred when the PhotoFoundation framework was included in an app.

## Source changes

* [Ignore PhotoFoundation classes in the runtime lookup (#31)](https://github.com/material-foundation/cocoapods-catalog-by-convention/commit/2e8866dcd15ed6a3e755c054510333438802e0a6) (featherless)

# 2.5.0

There is now a new `NSDictionary` property in `CBCNode` called metadata. It is meant to store all the information regarding an example
rather than using separate methods as previously done. With that said, we offer backwards compatibility and still allow the usage of methods to provide example information.

Before:
```
+ (NSArray *)catalogBreadcrumbs {
  return @[ @"Activity Indicator", @"Activity Indicator" ];
}

+ (NSString *)catalogDescription {
  return @"Activity Indicator is a visual indication of an app loading content. It can display how "
         @"long an operation will take or visualize an unspecified wait time.";
}

+ (BOOL)catalogIsPrimaryDemo {
  return YES;
}

+ (BOOL)catalogIsPresentable {
  return YES;
}
```

After:
```
+ (NSDictionary *)catalogMetadata {
  return @{@"breadcrumbs": @[ @"Activity Indicator", @"Activity Indicator" ],
           @"description": @"Activity Indicator is a visual indication of an app loading content. It can display how "
           @"long an operation will take or visualize an unspecified wait time.",
           @"primaryDemo": @YES,
           @"presentable": @YES};
}
```

## Source changes

 * [added a new metadata property that will hold all the key/values for that node. Also code refactoring (#27)](https://github.com/material-foundation/cocoapods-catalog-by-convention/commit/6c44e443e98bb87c955663c45c1245921338de1e) (Yarden Eitan)

# 2.3.0

This minor release adds two new functionalities that support our new Dragons app.

## New features

It's now possible to call `CBCCreatePresentableNavigationTree` to create a navigation tree that only consists of examples that implement the `catalogIsPresentable` method and return `YES` to it.
`CBCNode` now has a new property called `debugLeaf` which is also a `CBCNode`. If an example implements the `catalogIsDebug` method and returns `YES`, then that example will become the
`debugLeaf`. When the `debugLeaf` is set, then in the Dragons app it will become the initial view controller in the navigation. NOTE: If there are multiple examples that return `YES` to
`catalogIsDebug` then the last class that is parsed while going through the hierarchy is the one to be set as the `debugLeaf`.
